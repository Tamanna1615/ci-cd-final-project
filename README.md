ci-cd-final-project CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions and OpenShift Project Overview

This repository contains the ci-cd-final-project, which demonstrates the implementation of a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions, Tekton Pipelines, and OpenShift.

The goal of this project is to automate the build, test, and deployment process of a sample application by applying CI/CD concepts learned throughout the course.

The pipeline ensures that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, improving software reliability and reducing manual intervention.

Objectives

Implement Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions

Automate unit testing using a CI workflow

Use Tekton for task orchestration in OpenShift

Deploy the application using an OpenShift pipeline

Validate successful execution through logs and pipeline status

Tools and Technologies Used

GitHub Actions

Tekton Pipelines

OpenShift

Docker

Node.js / Python (based on sample application)

YAML

CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

Code is pushed to the GitHub repository (ci-cd-final-project).

GitHub Actions workflow is triggered automatically.

The workflow installs dependencies and runs unit tests.

Tekton tasks are executed for build and cleanup operations.

OpenShift pipeline deploys the application.

Application logs confirm successful deployment.
